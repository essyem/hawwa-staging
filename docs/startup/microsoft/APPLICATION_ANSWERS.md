Business Summary (short)
Hawwa Wellness provides culturally-aware postpartum care coordination and wellness services through a digital marketplace and operations platform for providers, clinics, and families. We connect mothers with vetted caregivers, automate assignment and scheduling, and provide operational analytics for clinics and vendors.

Problem
New mothers receive fragmented care and lack centralized follow-up and provider coordination. Clinics and vendors lack tools for assignments, scheduling, and operational reporting that are culturally tailored to the region.

Solution
A Django-based platform with:
- marketplace + booking
- automation for vendor assignment and operations
- patient-facing education and follow-up workflows
- admin analytics and financial reporting
