Hawwa Wellness — Technical Architecture (summary)

Overview
Hawwa Wellness is implemented as a Django monolith with a clear separation of apps and services. Components:
- Web: Django 5.x, Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- Data: PostgreSQL for relational data; optional timeseries DB for analytics
- Cache: Redis for sessions, Celery broker, and caching
- Background: Celery workers for scheduled tasks, email, and async processing
- Storage: S3-compatible object storage for media and backups
- ML / AI: Optional ML services hosted on GPU-enabled instances (NVIDIA) or Azure ML/GCP AI Platform
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana or Azure Monitor; ELK stack for logs

Service Boundaries
- `accounts`, `bookings`, `vendors`, `payments`, `change_management`, `reporting` — logical Django apps
- A small API gateway (NGINX) can be used to route and rate-limit API traffic

Deployment Options
- Docker Compose for development and quick demos
- Kubernetes (AKS/GKE/EKS) for production with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Secrets, and managed DB

Security
- Use environment variables for secrets and external credentials
- Enforce HTTPS with HSTS, secure cookies, and CSRF protection
- Role-based access control implemented via `Role`/`RoleAssignment` models

Scaling Notes
- Read replicas for Postgres and connection pooling
- Cache-heavy endpoints should use Redis for rate-limiting and partial response caching
- Offload ML training/inference to dedicated GPU instances or provider-managed services

Integration & Infra Credits
- Microsoft for Startups / Founders Hub: Azure credits, mentorship, technical support
- NVIDIA Inception: GPU credits and networking with ML partners
- AWS Activate / Google for Startups: Cloud credits and startup support

Development artifacts
- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml (recommended)
- `requirements.txt` and `requirements-frozen.txt` for pinned dependencies
- `manage.py` run instructions and sample data seeder
